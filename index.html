<h3><em>So easy your human companion could do it too!</em></h3>

  <p>JavaScript is a programming language or, in other words, a means by which
    a computer is instructed to do things. Just the same as one controls humans
    with hisses and meows, one controls computers with statements written in
    a programming language. All web browsers understand JavaScript and you
    can take advantage of that to make web pages do crazy things!</p>
  <p>JavaScript started as a programming language to make internet pages more
    interactive. Nowadays JavaScript runs in more places than just web browsers
    — it runs on web servers, phones and <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/WZkn5/show/light/">even robots</a>!
    This page will teach you some JavaScript basics so that you can get up
    and running in no time*!</p>
  <p>* <em>actual time: more than none. Probably an hour or two. Also since you are a cat you are less likely to run and more likely to lay around in the sun</em></p>

<h2>Don't be a scaredy-cat</h2>

  <p><span class="right"><img src="images/yarnify.png" alt="cat"></span>You
    will always land on your feet — even when programming! Unlike <a href="images/dealwithit.gif">pawing over a glass of water</a> on
    your laptop, <em>nothing</em> in these tutorials will damage your computer
    in any way, even if you mistype a command or click the wrong button. Unlike
    cats, computer programmers make mistakes all time: misspelling things,
    forgetting quotes or brackets, and being forgetful of how basic functions
    (and yarn) work. Programmers care more about making it work <em>eventually</em> rather
    than trying to make it work the very first time. The best way to learn
    is by making mistakes!</p>
  <p>So don't be a scaredy-cat! The absolute worst thing that will happen is
    that you might have to refresh this page in your web browser if you get
    stuck. Don't worry though, this will happen very rarely — and we're talkin'
    13-toed cat rare.</p>

<h2><a id="basics" href="#basics">#</a> The basics</h2>

  <p>There is JavaScript running on this page right now! Let's play around
    with it a little. For the sake of simplicity I'll assume you are using
    Google Chrome to read this page (if you aren't it's probably easier on
    both of us if you follow along with Chrome).</p>
  <p>First, right click anywhere on the screen and hit <strong>Inspect Element</strong>,
    then click on the <strong>Console</strong> tab. You should see a thingy that
    looks like this:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/console.png" alt="console">
  </p>
  <p>This is a console, otherwise known as a "command line" or "terminal".
    Basically its a way to type one thing at a time into a computer and immediately
    get the computer's answer back. They are super useful as a learning tool
    (I still use the console nearly every day that I'm coding).</p>
  <p>The console does some pretty cool stuff. Here I have started to type something
    and the console is helping me out by giving me a list of all the possible
    things I could continue to type! Another thing you could do is type
    <code
    data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="constant numeric">1</span>  <span class="keyword operator">+</span> 
      <span
      class="constant numeric">1</span>
        </code>into the console and then hit the <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">Enter</code> key
        and watch what happens.</p>
  <p>Using the console is a very important part of learning JavaScript. If
    you don't know if something works or what the command is for something,
    go to the console and figure it out! Here's an example:</p>

<h3><a id="strings" href="#strings">#</a> Strings</h3>

  <p>Since I am a cat I want to replace every instance of the word <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">dog</code> on the Internet with <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">those blasted dogs</code>. First go into your console and
    type in a few sentences that contain the word <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">dog</code> at least once. In JavaScript a bunch of letters,
    numbers, words or anything else is known as a <strong>String</strong> (as
    in a <em>string</em> of characters). Strings have to begin AND end with a
    quotation mark. Single <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">'</code> or
    double <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">"</code> is fine,
    just make sure you use the same at the beginning as you do at the end.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/console-strings.png" alt="console">
  </p>
  <p>See the nasty error message? Don't worry - you didn't break any laws.
    SyntaxError ILLEGAL is just the way it sounds when robots tell you that
    your program has a problem. The first two sentences had matching quotation
    marks at the beginning and end, but when I mixed single and double quotation
    marks it freaked out on me.</p>
  <p>OK, to fix up one of these sentences (by replacing <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">dog</code> with our enhanced version) we have to first save
    the original sentence so that we can call it up later when we do our replacing
    magic. Notice how the string gets repeated in red when we type it into
    the console? This is because we haven't told it to save the sentence anywhere
    so it just gives it right back (or it gives us an Error back if we messed
    something up).</p>

<h3><a id="values" href="#values">#</a> Values and variables</h3>

  <p><strong>Values</strong> are the simplest components in JavaScript.
    <code
    data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="constant numeric">1</span>
      </code>is a value, <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="constant language">true</span></code> is
      a value, <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">"hello"</code> is
      a value, <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword">function</span>() {}</code> is
      a value, the list goes on! There are a handful of different <strong>types</strong> of
      values in JavaScript but we don't need to go over them all right away —
      you will learn them naturally the more you code!</p>
  <p>To store values we use things called <strong>variables</strong>. The word
    'variable' means 'can change' and is used because variables can store many
    different types of values and can change their value many times. They are
    pretty much like mailboxes. We put something in a variable, like our sentence,
    and then give the variable an address that we can use to look up the sentence
    later. In real life mailboxes have to have PO Box numbers but in JavaScript
    you usually just use lowercase letters or numbers without any spaces.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/console-variables.png" alt="console">
  </p>
  <p><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword">var</span></code> is
    shorthand for variable and the <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword operator">=</span></code> means <em>store the thing on the right-hand side in the thing on the left-hand side</em>.
    Also as you can see, now that we are storing our sentence in a variable
    the console doesn't just return our sentence right away, but instead gives
    us <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">undefined</code> which
    means <em>there was nothing to return</em>.</p>
  <p>If you simply type a variable name into the console it will print out
    the value stored in that variable. A note about variables is that by default
    they go away when you switch to a different page. If I were to hit the
    Refresh button in Chrome, for example, my <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">dogSentence</code> variable would get wiped and it would
    be like it never existed. But don't worry about this too much for now —
    you can just hit the up or down arrows on your keyboard while in the console
    to go through everything you've entered in recently.</p>

<h3><a id="functions" href="#functions">#</a> Functions</h3>

  <p>Now that we have our sentence stored in a variable let's give that variable
    to something that will replace words! We call things that perform actions
    like this <strong>functions</strong> because, well, they serve a specific <em>function</em> (AKA
    purpose or action) for us. Calling them "actions" sounded weird I guess
    so they went with the word "function" instead.</p>
  <p>JavaScript has a function called <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">replace</code> that
    does exactly what we want! Functions take in any number of values (zero,
    one or many) and return either nothing (<code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">undefined</code>) or exactly one value (functions can't
    return two or more values at a time — only a single value). The <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">replace</code> function is available to use on any strings
    and takes in two values: the characters to take out and the characters
    to swap in. It gets confusing to describe these things so here is a visual
    example:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/console-replace.png" alt="console">
  </p>
  <p>Notice how the value of <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">dogSentence</code> is
    the same even after we run <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">replace</code> on
    it? This is because <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">replace</code> (and
    most JavaScript functions for that matter) takes the variable or value
    that we give it and returns a <strong>new value</strong> instead of modifying
    the thing we passed in. Since we didn't store the new variable (there is
    no <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword operator">=</span></code> on
    the left side of the replace function) it just printed out the return value
    in our console.</p>

<h3><a id="standard-library" href="#standard-library">#</a> The "standard library"</h3>

  <p>You might be wondering what other functions are available in JavaScript.
    The answer: A TON. There are lots <strong>built in, standard libraries</strong> that
    you can learn about at MDN (A site run by Mozilla that has lotsa nifty
    information about web technologies). For example <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math">here is the MDN page on JavaScript's Math object</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="third-party-javascript" href="#third-party-javascript">#</a> Third-party JavaScript</h3>

  <p>There is also a lot of JavaScript code available that is <strong>not built in</strong>.
    JavaScript from third parties is usually referred to as a "library" or
    "plugin". One of my favorites is called <strong>Underscore.js</strong>.
    Let's go and grab it and load it into our page! First go to the Underscore
    site, <a href="http://underscorejs.org/"></a><a href="http://underscorejs.org/">http://underscorejs.org/</a>,
    click on the download link (I usually use development versions because
    they are easier to read but both will give you the same basic functionality),
    and then copy all the code onto your clipboard (you can use Select All
    from the Edit menu to select everything).</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/underscore-source.png" alt="console">
  </p>
  <p>Then paste it into your console and hit enter. Now your browser has a
    new variable in it: <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">_</code>.
    Underscore gives you a ton of helpful functions to play with. We'll learn
    more about how to use them later.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/underscore-first.png" alt="console">
  </p>

<h3><a id="writing-functions" href="#writing-functions">#</a> Making new functions</h3>

  <p>You aren't limited to using other peoples functions — you can also write
    them yourself. It's pretty easy! Let's make a function called <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">makeMoreExciting</code> that adds a bunch of exclamation
    points to the end of a string.</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="storage function">function</span> <span class="entity name function">makeMoreExciting</span>(<span class="keyword">string</span>) {
  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">string</span> <span class="keyword operator">+</span> <span class="string">'!!!!'</span>
}</code></pre>

  <p>In my head I read it out loud like this: "there's a function called 'make
    more exciting' that takes in a string and returns a new copy of that string
    that has a bunch of exclamation points at the end". Here is how we would
    write this in the console manually if we weren't using a function:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/custom-function-manually.png" alt="console">
  </p>
  <p>The expression <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword">string</span> <span class="keyword operator">+</span> <span class="string">'!!!!'</span></code> returns
    a new string and our variable called <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword">string</span></code> stays
    the same as before (since we never updated it to anything else with
    <code
    data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword operator">=</span>
      </code>).</p>
  <p>Let's use our function instead of doing it manually. First, paste the
    function into the console and then <strong>call</strong> the function by <strong>passing in</strong> a
    string:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/custom-function-call.png" alt="console">
  </p>
  <p>You could also call the same function by passing in a variable that points
    to a string (in the above example we just typed the string straight in
    there as a value instead of saving it to a variable first):</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/custom-function-call-variable.png" alt="console">
  </p>
  <p>The line <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="function call">makeMoreExciting</span>(sentence)</code> is
    equivalent to saying <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">sentence <span class="keyword operator">+</span> <span class="string">'!!!!'</span></code>.
    What if we wanted to <strong>modify in-place</strong> (aka update) the value
    of sentence? Simply save the return value of the function back into our
    <code
    data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">sentence</code>variable:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword">var</span> sentence <span class="keyword operator">=</span> <span class="string">"time for a nap"</span>
sentence <span class="keyword operator">=</span> <span class="function call">makeMoreExciting</span>(sentence)</code></pre>

  <p>Now <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">sentence</code> will
    have the exclamation marks in it! Note that you only have to use <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow"><span class="keyword">var</span></code> when you are <strong>initializing</strong> a
    variable — the first time you ever use it. After that you shouldn't use
    <code
    data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword">var</span>
      </code>unless you want to re-initialize (reset/clear/empty) the variable.</p>
  <p>What would happen if we took out the <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword">return</span></code> statement
    in our function?</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/custom-function-no-return.png" alt="console">
  </p>
  <p>Why is <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">sentence</code> empty?
    Because functions return <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">undefined</code> by
    default! You can choose to return a value by <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow"><span class="keyword">return</span></code>ing something.
    Functions should take in a value and, if they change the value or create
    a new value that is supposed to be used later, <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow"><span class="keyword">return</span></code> a value (fun
    fact: a fancy term for this style is <em>functional programming</em>). Here
    is another function that doesn't return anything but instead uses a different
    method to show us the output:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="storage function">function</span> <span class="entity name function">yellIt</span>(<span class="keyword">string</span>) {
  <span class="keyword">string</span> <span class="keyword operator">=</span> <span class="keyword">string</span>.<span class="function call">toUpperCase</span>()
  <span class="keyword">string</span> <span class="keyword operator">=</span> <span class="function call">makeMoreExciting</span>(<span class="keyword">string</span>)
  console.<span class="support method">log</span>(<span class="keyword">string</span>)
}</code></pre>

  <p>This function, <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">yellIt</code>,
    uses our previous function <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">makeMoreExciting</code> as
    well as the built-in String method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase">toUpperCase</a>.
    Methods are just a name for a function when it belongs to something — in
    this case <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">toUpperCase</code> is
    a function that belongs to <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword">String</span></code> so
    we can refer to it as either a method <em>or</em> a function. <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">makeMoreExciting</code> on the other hand doesn't belong
    to anyone so it would be technically incorrect to refer to it as a method
    (confusing, I know).</p>
  <p>The last line of the function is another built-in that simply takes in
    any values that you give it and prints them out into the console.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/custom-function-console-log.png" alt="console">
  </p>
  <p>So is there something wrong with the above <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">yellIt</code> function? It depends! Here are the two major
    types of functions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>functions that modify or create values and return them</li>
    <li>functions take in values and perform some action that cannot be returned</li>
  </ul>
  <p><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">console.log</code> is
    an example of the second type of function: it prints things out to your
    console — an action that you can see with your eyes but that cannot be
    represented as a JavaScript value. My own rule of thumb is to try to keep
    the two types of functions separate from each other, so here's how I would
    rewrite the <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">yellIt</code> function:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="storage function">function</span> <span class="entity name function">yellIt</span>(<span class="keyword">string</span>) {
  <span class="keyword">string</span> <span class="keyword operator">=</span> <span class="keyword">string</span>.<span class="function call">toUpperCase</span>()
  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="function call">makeMoreExciting</span>(<span class="keyword">string</span>)
}

console.<span class="support method">log</span>(<span class="function call">yellIt</span>(<span class="string">"i fear no human"</span>))</code></pre>

  <p>This way <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">yellIt</code> becomes
    more <strong>generic</strong>, meaning it only does one or two simple little
    things and doesn't know anything about printing itself to a console — that
    part can always be programmed later, outside the function definition.</p>

<h3><a id="loops" href="#loops">#</a> Loops</h3>

  <p>Now that we have some basic skills under our belt (<em>Author's note: do cats even wear belts?</em>)
    we can start being lazy. What?! Yes, that's right: programming is about
    being lazy. Larry Wall, inventor of the Perl programming language, called
    laziness the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris">most important virtue</a> of
    a good programmer. If computers didn't exist you would have to do all sorts
    of tedious tasks by hand, but if you learn to program you can lay in the
    sun all day while a computer somewhere runs your programs for you. It is
    a glorious lifestyle filled with relaxation!</p>
  <p>Loops are one of the most important ways to harness the power of a computer.
    Remember <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">Underscore.js</code> from
    earlier? Make sure you have it loaded in the page (remember: you can just
    hit the up arrow on your keyboard a few times and then hit <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">Enter</code> to load it in again if you need to) and try
    copy/pasting this into your console:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="storage function">function</span> <span class="entity name function">logANumber</span>(someNumber) {
  console.<span class="support method">log</span>(someNumber)
}
_.<span class="function call">times</span>(<span class="constant numeric">10</span>, logANumber)</code></pre>

  <p>This code uses the <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#times">times</a> method
    of Underscore which takes in 1 number and 1 function and then starts from
    0 and for 10 steps counts up by 1, calling the function with the number
    each step of the way.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/times-loop.png" alt="console">
  </p>
  <p>If we were to manually write out what <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">times</code> is doing in the above code it would look like
    this:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="function call">logANumber</span>(0)
<span class="function call">logANumber</span>(1)
<span class="function call">logANumber</span>(2)
<span class="function call">logANumber</span>(3)
<span class="function call">logANumber</span>(4)
<span class="function call">logANumber</span>(5)
<span class="function call">logANumber</span>(6)
<span class="function call">logANumber</span>(7)
<span class="function call">logANumber</span>(8)
<span class="function call">logANumber</span>(9)</code></pre>

  <p>But cats refuse to do unnecessary manual work like this so we must always
    ask ourselves, <em>"am I doing this in the laziest way possible?"</em>.</p>
  <p>So why is this called looping? Think of it like this: If we were to write
    out a list of 10 numbers (from 0 to 9) using a JavaScript Array it would
    look like this:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword">var</span> zeroThroughTen <span class="keyword operator">=</span> [<span class="constant numeric">0</span>, <span class="constant numeric">1</span>, <span class="constant numeric">2</span>, <span class="constant numeric">3</span>, <span class="constant numeric">4</span>, <span class="constant numeric">5</span>, <span class="constant numeric">6</span>, <span class="constant numeric">7</span>, <span class="constant numeric">8</span>, <span class="constant numeric">9</span>]</code></pre>

  <p>What <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">times</code> really
    does is visit each number and repeat a task: in the example above the task
    was to call the <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">logANumber</code> function
    with the current number. Repeating tasks in this way is referred to as <em>looping over</em> the
    Array.</p>

<h3><a id="arrays" href="#arrays">#</a> Arrays</h3>

  <p>I've mentioned these a few times but let's spend a minute learning about
    them. Imagine you need to keep track of all your buddies. Well, an Array
    will do just fine. Think of an Array like a sorted list that you can keep <em>tons</em> of
    stuff in.</p>
  <p>This is how you make one:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">  <span class="keyword">var</span> myCatFriends <span class="keyword operator">=</span> [<span class="string">"tommy"</span>, <span class="string">"tabby"</span>, <span class="string">"ceiling"</span>]</code></pre>

  <p>Sweet! Now you have a list of your cat buddies.</p>
  <p>Elements (that is what you call a single item in an array) that are stored
    within arrays start at 0 and count up from there. So <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">myCatFriends[<span class="constant numeric">0</span>]</code> returns
    <code
    data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">tommy</code>and <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">myCatFriends[<span class="constant numeric">1</span>]</code> returns
      <code
      data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">tabby</code>... etc etc.</p>
  <p>To get buddies out of your brand new Array you can just access an element
    directly like so:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">  console.<span class="support method">log</span>(myCatFriends[<span class="constant numeric">0</span>])</code></pre>

  <p>

  <p>If you made a brand new cat friend at the hippest cat club the other night
    and you want to add them to your list it is super simple: <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">myCatFriends.<span class="support method">push</span>(<span class="string">"super hip cat"</span>)</code>.</p>
  <p>To check that the new cat made it into your array you can use <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">.<span class="support property">length</span></code>:</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/array-push-length.png" alt="console">
  </p>
  <p>Notice how <code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">push</code> returned
    the length? Handy! Also take note that arrays will always <strong>preserve ordering</strong> which
    means they will remember the order in which you added or defined things.
    Not everything in JavaScript preserves ordering so remember this special
    property of Arrays!</p>

<h3><a id="objects" href="#objects">#</a> Objects</h3>

  <p>Arrays are good for lists, but for other tasks they can be hard to work
    with. Consider our array of cat friends. What if you also wanted to store
    more than just names?</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword">var</span> myCatFriends <span class="keyword operator">=</span> [<span class="string">"tommy"</span>, <span class="string">"tabby"</span>, <span class="string">"ceiling"</span>]
<span class="keyword">var</span> lastNames <span class="keyword operator">=</span> [<span class="string">"the cat"</span>, <span class="string">"cat"</span>, <span class="string">"cat"</span>]
<span class="keyword">var</span> addresses <span class="keyword operator">=</span> [<span class="string">"The Alley"</span>, <span class="string">"Grandmas House"</span>, <span class="string">"Attic"</span>]</code></pre>

  <p>Sometimes it is nice to have all of the addresses or names in one variable.
    But sometimes you have a cat in mind, let's say Tommy, and you just want
    to look up that cat's address. With arrays it takes a lot of work because
    you can't just say 'hey array, give me Tommy's address' because 'Tommy'
    is in one array and his address is in a totally different array.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/array-lookup.png" alt="console">
  </p>
  <p>This can be brittle because if our arrays change and we add a new cat
    to the beginning we would have to also update our <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">tommysPosition</code> variable to point to the new location
    of Tommy's information in the arrays! Here is a easier to maintain way
    to store information like this using objects:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword">var</span> firstCat <span class="keyword operator">=</span> { name: <span class="string">"tommy"</span>, lastName: <span class="string">"the cat"</span>, address: <span class="string">"The Alley"</span> }
<span class="keyword">var</span> secondCat <span class="keyword operator">=</span> { name: <span class="string">"tabby"</span>, lastName: <span class="string">"cat"</span>, address: <span class="string">"Grandmas House"</span> }
<span class="keyword">var</span> thirdCat <span class="keyword operator">=</span> { name: <span class="string">"ceiling"</span>, lastName: <span class="string">"cat"</span>, address: <span class="string">"Attic"</span> }</code></pre>

  <p>Why would we do it this way? Because now we have a variable for each cat
    that we can use to get that cats values in a more convenient and readable
    way.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="images/object-lookup.png" alt="console">
  </p>
  <p>You can think of Objects like keys on a keyring. Each one is for a specific
    door and if you have nice labels on your keys you can open doors very fast.
    In fact, the things on the left hand side of the <code data-language="javascript"
    class="rainbow">:</code> are called <strong>keys</strong> (are also known
    as <strong>properties</strong>) and the things on the right hand side are <strong>values</strong>.</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="comment">// an object with a single key 'name' and single value 'tommy'</span>
{ name: <span class="string">'tommy'</span> }</code></pre>

  <p>So why would you ever use arrays if you can just put your data in objects?
    Because objects don't remember the order of the keys that you set. You
    might enter in an object like this:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">{ date: <span class="string">"10/20/2012"</span>, diary: <span class="string">"slept a bit today"</span>, name: <span class="string">"Charles"</span> }</code></pre>

  <p>But the computer could give it back to you like this:</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">{ diary: <span class="string">"slept a bit today"</span>, name: <span class="string">"Charles"</span>, date: <span class="string">"10/20/2012"</span> }</code></pre>

  <p>Or like this!</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow">{ name: <span class="string">"Charles"</span>, diary: <span class="string">"slept a bit today"</span>, date: <span class="string">"10/20/2012"</span> }</code></pre>

  <p>So you can't ever trust the order of keys in objects. If you wanna get
    REALLY fancy you can make an array filled with objects, or an object filled
    with arrays!</p>
<pre><code data-language="javascript" class="rainbow"><span class="keyword">var</span> moodLog <span class="keyword operator">=</span> [
  {
    date: <span class="string">"10/20/2012"</span>,
    mood: <span class="string">"catnipped"</span>
  }, 
  {
    date: <span class="string">"10/21/2012"</span>,
    mood: <span class="string">"nonplussed"</span>
  },
  {
    date: <span class="string">"10/22/2012"</span>,
    mood: <span class="string">"purring"</span>
  }
]

<span class="comment">// ordered from least to most favorite</span>
<span class="keyword">var</span> favorites <span class="keyword operator">=</span> {
  treats: [<span class="string">"bird sighting"</span>, <span class="string">"belly rub"</span>, <span class="string">"catnip"</span>],
  napSpots: [<span class="string">"couch"</span>, <span class="string">"planter box"</span>, <span class="string">"human face"</span>]
}</code></pre>

  <p>When you combine different things like this you are making <strong>data structures</strong>,
    just like legos!</p>

  <p>I'd recommend coming back again tomorrow and going through the entire
    thing again from the beginning! It might take a few times through before
    you get everything (programming is hard). Just try to avoid reading this
    page in any rooms that contain shiny objects . . . they can be incredibly
    distracting.</p>
